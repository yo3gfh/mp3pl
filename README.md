## MP3PL, a small mp3 and flac player

Copyright (c) 2002-2020 Adrian Petrila, YO3GFH<br>
Uses the BASS sound system by Ian Luck (http://www.un4seen.com/)<br>
Inspired by the examples included with the bass library.

This was my "most ambitious" project at the time, right before being
drafted in the army. Dugged out recently and dusted off to compile with
Pelle's C compiler.

Please note that this is cca. 20 years old code, not particullary something
to write home about :-))

It's taylored to my own needs, modify it to suit your own. I'm not a professional programmer,
so this isn't the best code you'll find on the web, you have been warned :-))

All the bugs are guaranteed to be genuine, and are exclusively mine =)
